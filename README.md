# PurdueDjikstrasAlgorithm
Worked with a team to create a working Djikstra's Shortest Path algorithm using Purdue University's buildings as nodes placed on a graph (data type) 

Written in C

Two input .txt files: 
1.
Start_Node End_Node

Ex. 
A E

2. 
Number_of_nodes Number_of_connections
Node1 X_coordinate Y_coordinate //first node for graph
Node2 X_coordinate Y_coordinate //second node for graph
Node1 Node2 //node one and two are connected

Ex.
5 7
A 1.3 1.8
B 1.3 2.4
C 2.3 3.9
D 3.8 4.6
E 3.2 6.3
A B
A C
A D
B A
B C
C D
C E 
D E

Outputs shortest path in terminal
